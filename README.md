# ChatGPT-with-Python

GPT Chat is a chatbot based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that can carry out sophisticated conversational interactions with its users. The chatbot can provide answers when users send questions or commands to create something in text form. Apart from composing poetry, GPT Chat can also do other text-based things, such as explaining how an object works, describing something, making travel plans, writing essays, and many other things. GPT Chat itself was developed by OpenAI, a company from Uncle Sam's country that focuses on developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. This chatbot is based on GPT-3.5, a natural language model that uses a deep learning learning process. Currently, besides English, GPT Chat also supports Indonesian. So, users in Indonesia can ask questions or commands in Indonesian which will then receive answers in the same language.
